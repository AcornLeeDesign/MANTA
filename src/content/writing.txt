Trees sway with the wind, through peace and torrents, and creatures with the ripples of land and water. Beauty is found in the flight of birds, the hunt of lions. Cicadas chittering and minnows amassing.

Beauty is in the unfathomable concept of plain existence. God imagined, designed, and created all this with intention, for the world to plainly exist in all its beauty, seemingly meaningless and unpredictable. All to be simply "good".

If the world was created in this way, who are we to stop ourselves from realizing any imagination? Will its existence not be beautiful?
