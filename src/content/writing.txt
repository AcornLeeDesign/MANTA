A digital sculpture. Something to simply exist somewhere; an artwork floating on the internet. We believe that nothing beautiful has to exist for a reason because beauty is imagination realized. 
 
Who can judge imagination? Is it good or is it bad? Or is it simply beautiful for something to just be. 
 
Trees sway with the wind, through peace and torrents, and creatures simply live as they are. The beauty, is it in their actions, or is it in the simple yet unfathomable fact that they were created as they are?
